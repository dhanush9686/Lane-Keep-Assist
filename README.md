Overview
This project aims to implement a Lane Keep Assist (LKA) system using Python. LKA is a driver-assistance technology designed to help prevent lane departures by providing steering corrections.

Prerequisites
  Python: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
  Required Libraries:
  OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
  NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
  Matplotlib: For visualization.
  Other libraries (if needed): Depending on your specific implementation, you might require additional libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-image.
